            # To allow triggering deploy.yml, we should either rely on a PAT or just deploy from this job.
            # Best practice without PAT is just to push, and let the user manually trigger deploy if needed, OR we can combine them.
            # Since the requirement is to update the website, let's use the default token. If deploy.yml needs to trigger, the user might need to adjust their repo settings. 
            # Actually, standard push from GITHUB_TOKEN does not trigger other actions.
